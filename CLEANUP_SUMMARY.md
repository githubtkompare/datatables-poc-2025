# Database Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all deprecated database objects and updated application code to work with the new streamlined database structure.

## Removed Database Objects

### Tables
- **software_unit_assignments** - No longer needed as software-to-unit relationships are handled directly via `software_products.university_unit_id`
- **audit_log** - Audit functionality was not implemented and table was empty

### Views  
- **v_software_with_roles** - Replaced with direct queries in AdminController
- **v_employee_roles** - Replaced with direct queries in AdminController  
- **v_unit_software_summary** - No longer needed as unit software counts use direct relationship

## Updated Code Files

### 1. Database Configuration
- **src/Config/Database.php**
  - Removed `software_unit_assignments` from table statistics array

### 2. Models
- **src/Models/UniversityUnit.php**  
  - Removed deprecated `assignSoftwareToUnit()` and `removeSoftwareFromUnit()` methods
  - Updated `getAllUnits()` and `getUnitSoftware()` methods to use direct relationship (previously updated)

### 3. Controllers  
- **src/Controllers/AdminController.php**
  - Updated `testTableIntegrity()` method to test new relationship structure
  - Updated `testComplexQueries()` method to use direct queries instead of deprecated views
  - Updated `testDatabasePerformance()` method to use new relationship structure
  - Updated `testSearchPerformance()` method to use `software_products.university_unit_id`

### 4. Templates
- **src/Views/templates/units/index.twig** 
  - Removed "Active Software" column and related DataTables configuration (previously updated)

## Current Database Structure

### Active Tables
1. **employees** - Staff members with roles
2. **university_units** - Organizational units
3. **software_products** - Software with direct unit assignment via `university_unit_id`  
4. **operating_systems** - OS platforms
5. **software_operating_systems** - Software-OS compatibility
6. **software_roles** - Role assignments (business owner, technical owner, technical manager)

### Key Relationships
- **Software → University Unit**: Direct via `software_products.university_unit_id`
- **Software → Roles**: One-to-one via `software_roles.software_id`
- **Software → Operating Systems**: Many-to-many via `software_operating_systems`
- **University Unit Assignment**: Automatic based on business owner's department

## Benefits of Cleanup

✅ **Simplified Structure** - Direct relationships eliminate unnecessary junction table  
✅ **Better Performance** - Fewer JOINs required for common queries  
✅ **Cleaner Admin Dashboard** - Only relevant statistics displayed  
✅ **Reduced Complexity** - No deprecated objects to maintain  
✅ **Consistent Application** - All code uses current database structure  

## Verification
- All deprecated database objects successfully dropped
- Application tested and functioning correctly
- Admin dashboard tests updated and working
- No orphaned references in codebase

The database and application are now fully cleaned up and optimized for the current requirements structure.
