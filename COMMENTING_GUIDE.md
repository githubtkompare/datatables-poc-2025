# Code Commenting Guide for DataTables POC 2025

## Overview

This guide provides the established commenting standards for the DataTables POC 2025 project. All PHP classes, methods, properties, and functions should follow these patterns for consistency and maintainability.

## Class-Level Documentation

Each class should have a comprehensive header comment that includes:

```php
/**
 * [Class Name] for [primary purpose/responsibility]
 * 
 * [Detailed description of the class's purpose, functionality, and role
 * in the application. Include information about design patterns,
 * integration points, and key features.]
 * 
 * Features:
 * - [Key feature 1]
 * - [Key feature 2]
 * - [Key feature 3]
 * - [Additional features...]
 * 
 * @author DataTables POC Team
 * @version 1.0.0
 */
```

## Method-Level Documentation

Each method should have documentation that includes:

```php
/**
 * [Brief description of what the method does]
 * 
 * [Detailed explanation of the method's functionality, including
 * business logic, data processing, and any important behavior
 * or side effects.]
 * 
 * @param [type] $paramName [Description of parameter]
 * @param [type|null] $optionalParam [Description of optional parameter]
 * @return [type] [Description of return value]
 * @throws [ExceptionType] [When this exception is thrown]
 */
```

## Property Documentation

Class properties should be documented with:

```php
/**
 * [Description of the property's purpose]
 * @var [type]
 */
private $propertyName;
```

## Function Documentation

Standalone functions should follow the same pattern as methods:

```php
/**
 * [Brief description of function purpose]
 * 
 * [Detailed explanation of functionality]
 * 
 * @param [type] $param [Description]
 * @return [type] [Description]
 */
function functionName($param)
```

## Specific Commenting Patterns by File Type

### Controllers

Focus on:

- Request handling and routing
- Data validation and processing
- Template rendering
- Error handling
- HTTP response management

### Models

Focus on:

- Database operations and CRUD functionality
- Data relationships and business rules
- Stored procedure usage
- Error handling and logging
- Data validation

### Configuration Classes

Focus on:

- Singleton pattern implementation
- Service initialization
- Environment configuration
- Security considerations
- Integration points

### API Endpoints

Focus on:

- HTTP method and content type handling
- Request parameter processing
- JSON response structure
- Error handling and logging
- Frontend integration purpose
- Search/filtering functionality

Example:

```php
/**
 * API endpoint for employee autocomplete suggestions
 * 
 * Returns JSON response containing employee data that matches the search
 * query parameter. Used by frontend autocomplete functionality for role
 * assignment fields (business owner, technical owner, technical manager).
 * Searches across first name, last name, and full name combinations.
 */
public function getEmployeeSuggestions()
```

### Templates and JavaScript

Focus on:

- Section headers for major functionality blocks
- Inline comments for complex logic or business rules
- Variable declarations with purpose
- Event handler explanations
- AJAX call descriptions

Example patterns:

```javascript
// Employee autocomplete functionality
let employeeTimeout;
let selectedEmployees = {}; // Track valid employee selections

// Debounce the API call by 300ms
employeeTimeout = setTimeout(function() {
    // AJAX implementation
}, 300);

// Setup autocomplete for all three role fields
setupEmployeeAutocomplete('business_owner_name', 'business_owner_id', 'business_owner_list');
```

## Examples from Completed Files

### Class Header Example (from Database.php)

```php
/**
 * Database connection manager using singleton pattern
 * 
 * This class handles all database connectivity and provides centralized
 * database configuration management. It implements the singleton pattern
 * to ensure only one database connection exists throughout the application.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Singleton pattern for connection management
 * - MySQL-specific configuration with timezone handling
 * - Connection testing and monitoring capabilities
 * - Table statistics and structure introspection
 * - Error handling and logging
 * 
 * @author DataTables POC Team
 * @version 1.0.0
 */
```

### Method Example (from Employee.php)

```php
/**
 * Create a new employee record
 * 
 * Adds a new employee to the database using stored procedure with
 * data validation and constraint checking. Returns the newly created
 * employee's ID for further operations.
 * 
 * @param array $data Associative array of employee data including:
 *                   - first_name: Employee's first name
 *                   - last_name: Employee's last name
 *                   - email: Employee's email address (must be unique)
 *                   - phone: Employee's phone number
 *                   - university_unit_id: Associated university unit ID
 *                   - job_title: Employee's job title
 * @return int|null Newly created employee ID, or null if creation failed
 */
public function createEmployee($data): ?int
```

### API/Autocomplete Method Example (from SoftwareProduct.php)

```php
/**
 * Retrieve unique software versions for autocomplete functionality
 * 
 * Returns distinct software versions matching the optional search term.
 * Used for version field autocomplete in software forms. Limited to 5 results
 * for performance and excludes null or empty versions.
 * 
 * @param string|null $search Optional search term to filter versions
 * @return array Array of unique version strings
 */
public function getUniqueVersions($search = null): array
```

8. **Search Functionality**: Clearly document search patterns and filtering logic

## Maintenance Guidelines

With all files now fully documented, maintain consistency by:

1. **New Methods**: Always add comprehensive docblock comments for any new methods following established patterns
2. **API Endpoints**: Document frontend integration context and JSON response structures
3. **Search/Autocomplete**: Include performance considerations and search pattern documentation
4. **Parameter Updates**: Keep @param and @return documentation current when method signatures change
5. **Error Handling**: Document new exception types and error conditions
6. **Business Logic**: Explain complex business rules and validation logic in method descriptions
7. **Integration Points**: Document relationships between models and controllers
