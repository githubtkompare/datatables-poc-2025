# Code Commenting Guide for DataTables POC 2025

## Overview

This guide provides the established commenting standards for the DataTables POC 2025 project. All PHP classes, methods, properties, and functions should follow these patterns for consistency and maintainability.

## Class-Level Documentation

Each class should have a comprehensive header comment that includes:

```php
/**
 * [Class Name] for [primary purpose/responsibility]
 * 
 * [Detailed description of the class's purpose, functionality, and role
 * in the application. Include information about design patterns,
 * integration points, and key features.]
 * 
 * Features:
 * - [Key feature 1]
 * - [Key feature 2]
 * - [Key feature 3]
 * - [Additional features...]
 * 
 * @author DataTables POC Team
 * @version 1.0.0
 */
```

## Method-Level Documentation

Each method should have documentation that includes:

```php
/**
 * [Brief description of what the method does]
 * 
 * [Detailed explanation of the method's functionality, including
 * business logic, data processing, and any important behavior
 * or side effects.]
 * 
 * @param [type] $paramName [Description of parameter]
 * @param [type|null] $optionalParam [Description of optional parameter]
 * @return [type] [Description of return value]
 * @throws [ExceptionType] [When this exception is thrown]
 */
```

## Property Documentation

Class properties should be documented with:

```php
/**
 * [Description of the property's purpose]
 * @var [type]
 */
private $propertyName;
```

## Function Documentation

Standalone functions should follow the same pattern as methods:

```php
/**
 * [Brief description of function purpose]
 * 
 * [Detailed explanation of functionality]
 * 
 * @param [type] $param [Description]
 * @return [type] [Description]
 */
function functionName($param)
```

## Specific Commenting Patterns by File Type

### Controllers

Focus on:

- Request handling and routing
- Data validation and processing
- Template rendering
- Error handling
- HTTP response management

### Models

Focus on:

- Database operations and CRUD functionality
- Data relationships and business rules
- Stored procedure usage
- Error handling and logging
- Data validation

### Configuration Classes

Focus on:

- Singleton pattern implementation
- Service initialization
- Environment configuration
- Security considerations
- Integration points

## Examples from Completed Files

### Class Header Example (from Database.php)

```php
/**
 * Database connection manager using singleton pattern
 * 
 * This class handles all database connectivity and provides centralized
 * database configuration management. It implements the singleton pattern
 * to ensure only one database connection exists throughout the application.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Singleton pattern for connection management
 * - MySQL-specific configuration with timezone handling
 * - Connection testing and monitoring capabilities
 * - Table statistics and structure introspection
 * - Error handling and logging
 * 
 * @author DataTables POC Team
 * @version 1.0.0
 */
```

### Method Example (from Employee.php)

```php
/**
 * Create a new employee record
 * 
 * Adds a new employee to the database using stored procedure with
 * data validation and constraint checking. Returns the newly created
 * employee's ID for further operations.
 * 
 * @param array $data Associative array of employee data including:
 *                   - first_name: Employee's first name
 *                   - last_name: Employee's last name
 *                   - email: Employee's email address (must be unique)
 *                   - phone: Employee's phone number
 *                   - university_unit_id: Associated university unit ID
 *                   - job_title: Employee's job title
 * @return int|null Newly created employee ID, or null if creation failed
 */
public function createEmployee($data): ?int
```

## Files Completed with Full Documentation

- ✅ Auth.php
- ✅ Database.php
- ✅ TwigConfig.php
- ✅ BaseController.php
- ✅ HomeController.php
- ✅ Employee.php (complete)
- ✅ SoftwareProduct.php (class header)
- ✅ UniversityUnit.php (class header)
- ✅ index.php

## Files Needing Method-Level Comments

- ❌ AdminController.php
- ❌ EmployeeController.php
- ❌ SoftwareController.php
- ❌ UniversityUnitController.php
- ❌ SoftwareProduct.php (methods)
- ❌ UniversityUnit.php (methods)

## Implementation Notes

1. **Consistency**: All comments should follow the established patterns
2. **Clarity**: Focus on explaining WHY something is done, not just WHAT
3. **Context**: Include business context and integration information
4. **Maintenance**: Keep comments up-to-date when code changes
5. **Standards**: Follow PHPDoc standards for IDE integration

## Next Steps

To complete the commenting for all remaining files, apply these patterns systematically to:

1. Add class-level headers to all controller classes
2. Document all public, protected, and private methods
3. Add property documentation where missing
4. Ensure all parameters and return values are properly documented
5. Include error handling and exception information

This comprehensive commenting approach will significantly improve code maintainability, developer onboarding, and long-term project sustainability.
